# Hello, I'm Drilon Toska

I am an up-and-coming cybersecurity professional with a strong academic background in computer science and cybersecurity, holding both a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree from Fairleigh Dickinson University. I enjoy working hands-on with security tools, analyzing vulnerabilities, and continuously expanding my technical skill set. This portfolio highlights my learning journey and applied cybersecurity projects.

## Objective

I am currently working as a Network Technician & IT Support Specialist at Network Security Group, Inc., where I support real-world production environments across municipal and public safety systems. My role includes administering SonicWall firewalls, site-to-site VPNs, Cisco switching and VLAN segmentation, Active Directory access controls, and endpoint security solutions such as CrowdStrike and Red Canary in CJIS-controlled environments. This experience has given me direct exposure to enterprise networking, security operations, and incident response in high-stakes settings.

While my current position has provided a strong foundation in networking and defensive security, my goal is to continuously expand my technical depth and cybersecurity expertise. Through this GitHub portfolio, I document my ongoing learning journey by building labs, security tools, scripts, and projects that go beyond day-to-day IT tasks. I am especially focused on strengthening my skills in security analysis, threat detection, automation, and secure system design as I grow into a well-rounded cybersecurity professional.
